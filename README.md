# Fancy-AutoHotkey-Scripts
 Some AutoHotkey Code I use occasionally, and you might want to as well...

The different code snippets are...

- OpenObsidian: Opens Obsidian ([obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)) using the Hotkey AltGr + O. Opening here means to bring the Obsidian window to the front if it exists, or to start the program if it does not. Because I close my windows way too soon... (If you use this, you will need to change the path to your obsidian.exe) By changing the path to whatever program you like, you could technically use this for everything.

- AppendToObsidianDailyNotes: Appends given text (input via [*InputBox*](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/lib/InputBox.htm)) to todays dailyNote in Obsidian ([obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)) using the Hotkey AltGr + A. (If you use this, you will need to change the path to your Vault)

- Photopea: Just opens [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com) in your Browser (Firefox). It's basically a bookmark that doesn't require you to open the browser.

- FocusActiveWindow: Sets the active window so that no other windows can overlay it (see [WinSetAlwaysOnTop](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/lib/WinSetAlwaysOnTop.htm)) The default shortcut for toggling the AlwaysOnTop-State is Ctrl + Space.

- DisableCapsLock: A script permanently disabling the CapsLock key.

- CapsLock as Modifier Key: Who uses CapsLock? ... Exactly. You might as well use it as a modifier key like shift. *Note: Caps Lock is disabled when using any of these scripts.*
    - CapsLockToF24: Did you know, there aren't just 12 but 24 function keys. (At least in theory, they usually don't show up on everyday keyboards (The full size Apple Magic Keyboard comes with F1 to F19 function keys.)) Anyway, CapsLockToF24 converts a press of CapsLock to a key press of F24. F24 can then be used as a hotkey in any program.

    - AdjustVolume: Utilising the CapsLock key as a modifier key as well as the PageUp and PageDown Keys you can adjust your computer's volume.

    - Search: Opens an InputBox for you to quickly search something on different sites:
        - Google Search *(CapsLock + G)*
        - Wikipedia Search *(CapsLock + W)*
        - YouTube Search *(CapsLock + Y)*
        - Translator *(CapsLock + D)*: Uses the [DeepL translator](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator).
        - Thesaurus Search *(CapsLock + T)*: Utilises [OpenThesaurus](https://www.openthesaurus.de/) (german).

    - SelectedSearch: Searches your currently selected text on different sites:
        - Google Search *(Ctrl + CapsLock + G)*
        - Wikipedia Search *(Ctrl + CapsLock + W)*
        - YouTube Search *(Ctrl + CapsLock + Y)*
        - Translator *(Ctrl + CapsLock + D)*: Uses the [DeepL translator](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator).
        - Thesaurus Search *(Ctrl + CapsLock + T)*: Utilises [OpenThesaurus](https://www.openthesaurus.de/) (german).
