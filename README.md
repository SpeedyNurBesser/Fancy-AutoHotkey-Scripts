# Fancy-AutoHotkey-Scripts
 Some AutoHotkey Code I use occasionally, and you might want to as well...

The different code snippets are...

- OpenObsidian: Opens Obsidian ([obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)) using the Hotkey AltGr + O. Opening here means to bring the Obsidian window to the front if it exists, or to start the program if it does not. Because I close my windows way too soon... (If you use this, you will need to change the path to your obsidian.exe) By changing the path to whatever program you like, you could technically use this for everything.

- AppendToObsidianDailyNotes: Appends given text (input via [*InputBox*](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/lib/InputBox.htm)) to todays dailyNote in Obsidian ([obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)) using the Hotkey AltGr + A. (If you use this, you will need to change the path to your Vault)

- Photopea: Just opens [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com) in your Browser (Firefox). It's basically a bookmark that doesn't require you to open the browser.

- German Hotstrings (I use, when writing German): 
    - bzw. -> beziehungsweise
    - bspw. -> beispielsweise
    - Bsp. -> Beispiel
    - z. B. -> zum Beispiel
    - u. A. -> unter Anderem
    - d. h. -> das heiÃŸt
